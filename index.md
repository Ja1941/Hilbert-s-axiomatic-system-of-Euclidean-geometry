    <h2>Notations</h2>
    <p> $AB$ : segment $A$ $B$ </p>
    <p> $A*B*C$ : $B$ is between $A$ and $C$ </p>
  
    <h2>Pasch's axiom B4</h2>
    <p>
    This axiom says that if a line enters a triangle in one side, it must exit in one of the two other sides, but not both. As in the figure, $A$, $B$ and $C$ are not on $l$           and $l$ intersects with segment $AB$, so it should intersect with either $AC$ or $BC$.

    <h2>lemma two_pt_between</h2>

    <p>
    This lemma asserts the existence of a point between two distinct points, using Pasch's. Given two distinct points $A$ and $B$, we find another point $C$ such that they are         noncollinear. Then we extend $A$ and $C$ to $D$, $B$ and $D$ to $E$ and use Pasch's on points $A$ $B$ $D$ and line $CE$.
    </p>
    <p>
    First we need to prove that the three points are not on $(C-â‚—E)$. This is not as easy as it looks on the graph, which involves a series of collinearity arguments. Then as line     $CE$ intersects $AD$ at $C$, Pasch's says it either intersects $AB$ or $BD$. The first case is exactly what we want, and the second case leads to a contradiction: if they         intersect at $x$, which is also the intersection of line $CE$ and \underline{line} $BD$ that is supposed to be $E$. By uniqueness, $x = E$ but $B*x*D$ and $B*D*E$, which is       contradiction by our axioms.

    <h2>An Identity of Ramanujan</h2>

    <h2>Maxwell's Equations</h2>

    <p>
    \begin{align}
      \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} &amp; = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}} \\
      \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} &amp; = 4 \pi \rho \\
      \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} &amp; = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\
      \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} &amp; = 0
    \end{align}
    </p>

    <h2>In-line Mathematics</h2>

    <p>Finally, while display equations look good for a page of samples, the
    ability to mix math and text in a paragraph is also important.  This
    expression $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$ is an example of an inline equation.  As
    you see, MathJax equations can be used this way as well, without unduly
    disturbing the spacing between lines.</p>
